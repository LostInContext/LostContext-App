# LostContext-App


A small app allowing you to use the Awareness API in order to launch a playlist when some conditions are reunited.  

For example, you can launch a playlist each time you plug-in your headphones while walking.

If we meet some day, and you think this stuff is worth it, you can buy me a beer in return.
