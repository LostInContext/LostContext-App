# LostContext-App


A small app allowing you to use the Awareness API in order to launch a playlist when some conditions are verified.  

For example, you can launch a playlist each time you plug-in your headphones while walking.


# Kotlin

100 % of the app has also been rewritten in Kotlin on the  [corresponding branch](https://github.com/LostInContext/LostContext-App/tree/kotlin)

It is also a good example of how to make Dagger 2 and DataBinding work with Kotlin.
