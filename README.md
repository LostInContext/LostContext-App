# LostContext-App


A small app leveraging the Awareness API in order to launch a playlist when some conditions are verified.  

For example, you can launch a playlist each time you plug-in your headphones while walking.


# Kotlin

The app is now 100% written in kotlin.  
The java code is kept on a legacy [java](https://github.com/LostInContext/LostContext-App/tree/java) branch but won't be updated.

It is also a good example of how to make Dagger 2 and DataBinding work with Kotlin.
